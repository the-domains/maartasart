**When you love to create beauty you might be inspired by more than one blinking star....**

I was always thinking that I didn't have my own style and was fond of creative people who were able to follow their one and only style for their whole life. Me, I felt I was having too many ideas that I wanted to try out and to realise; and always when I thought that I finally found my style and final passion some new inspirations crossed my path. It took me years to understood that I was simply too multifaceted and lively to be able to just reduce everything to one thing and that it was not about being not capable or having no talent. I realised that I was always good for surprises in all kind of ways throughout my life and that was what my friends always defined as an interesting and free lifestyle.

After becoming aware that almost everybody loves positive surprises and a group of people love the stuff I create, I decided to make my multifacettedness my label and surprise myself and others whomlike to be part of it with what I create next and share my actual thoughts and wisdom accompanying my creative process with them.

So.... in this Sense, if you are one of them, just jump on and join me on my new journey and enjoy!
